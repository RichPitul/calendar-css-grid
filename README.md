# calendar-css-grid

Interested in responsive calendars and how to structure them best. With the minimum amount off html and css. 

Things important to me for the calendar at this time.
Switching to a vertical day planner type view on mobile.
When enough space is available and the entire month is displayed day blocks are responsive perfect squares.
Simplicity when it comes to spacing out the first day of the month.
No extra markup to maintain each week in the calendar.
Works well for 5 week or 4 week months
Works with full page width; but also as a component with a set width

Haven't yet figured out a good way to be able to size the parent by height and have the dimensions within the calendar size correctly like they do by setting the parent's width
